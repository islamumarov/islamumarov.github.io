## Introduction

A few months ago I started to prepare for coding interviews for FAANG companies. I am using the course Grokking the Coding Interview - Patterns for Coding Questions in educative.io to prepare for the interviews. I am also solving LeetCode problems. I will write about my experience and share my explanations of the problems and approaches I used to solve them. I think blogging about my experience will help me to remember the concepts and approaches I used to solve the problems because I heard that by teaching something you learn it better.

## Patterns List

Here it the list of the problems I solved so far:

* [Sliding Window](https://github.com/islamumarov/GrokkingCodingInterview/tree/master/2%20SlidingWindow)
* [Two Pointers](https://github.com/islamumarov/GrokkingCodingInterview/tree/master/TwoPointers)
